There can be a potential $V$ in the box. So let us a meshgrid of $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ coordinates.\nN = 100\rL = 10.0\rŒîx¬≤ = (2*L/N)^2\rfunction meshgrid(x::LinRange{Float64, Int64}, y::LinRange{Float64, Int64})::Tuple{Matrix{Float64}, Matrix{Float64}}\rX = [x for _ in y, x in x]\rY = [y for y in y, _ in x]\rX, Y\rend\rx = LinRange(-L, L, N)\ry = LinRange(-L, L, N)\rX, Y = meshgrid(x, y);\r Potential The potential is chosen to be eightfold rotation symmetric quasicrystal, centered on $\\mathbf{r}=0,$ $$\rV(\\mathbf{r})=V_{0} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} \\cos ^{2}\\left(\\mathbf{G}_{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}\\right)\r$$\rwhere $V_{0}$ is the potential amplitude and the quantities $G_{k}$ are the lattice vectors of four mutually incoherent standing waves oriented at the angles $0^{\\circ}, 45^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}$, and $135^{\\circ}$, respectively. The lattice vectors have norm $\\left|G_{k}\\right|=\\pi / a$.\nfunction get_potential(x, y, V‚ÇÄ)\rreturn V‚ÇÄ*(cos(pi*x)^2 + cos(pi*‚àö2/2*(x+y))^2 + cos(pi*y)^2 + cos(-pi/(‚àö2)*(x-y))^2)\rend\r# def get_potential(x, y):\r# return np.exp(-(x-0.3)**2/(2*0.1**2))*np.exp(-(y-0.3)**2/(2*0.1**2))\rV = get_potential.(X,Y, 0.005)\rfig = figure(figsize=(6.2,5))\rcontourf(X, Y, V, 50)\r# pcolormesh(X, Y, V, cmap=:RdBu)\rcolorbar()\r# plot_surface(X, Y, V)\r    PyObject \u0026lt;matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar object at 0x0000000081FE1460\u0026gt;\r Units The Schr√∂dinger equation is given by $$ \\left[\\frac{-\\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \\nabla^{2}+V(\\mathbf{r})\\right] \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E\\psi(\\mathbf{r}),$$ Let us use the lattice spacing $a$ and the corresponding recoil energy $E_r = \\pi^2\\hbar^2/2ma^2$ as the space and energy units, respectively, such that we have $$\r\\left[\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2mE_ra^2} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2}+\\frac{V(\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}})}{E_r}\\right] \\psi(\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}) = \\left[\\frac{-1}{\\pi^2} \\tilde{\\nabla}^{2}+\\tilde{V}_{0} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} \\cos ^{2}\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{G}}_{k} \\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{r}}\\right)\\right] \\psi(\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}) = \\tilde{E}\\psi(\\mathbf{\\tilde{r}}),\r$$\rwhere $|\\tilde{\\mathbf{G}}_{k}|=\\pi$, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{r}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{a}$, and $\\tilde{E}=\\frac{E}{E_r}$.\nDiscretize in one dimension Rest us to discretize our Hamiltonian. The idea can be easily explained by the following finite difference approximation of the second derivative in one dimension $$ \\frac{d^2 \\psi}{dx^2} \\approx \\frac{\\psi_{i+1}-2\\psi_i + \\psi_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2}.$$\nDirichlet boundary conditions Suppose we have $M=4$ interior points and $a$ and $b$ two boundary points, a mesh with four interior points $\\Delta x=2L /(M+1)$, represented as follows \\begin{align*} \u0026amp;\\qquad \\ \\ a \\ \\ \\ \\ 1 \\ \\ \\ \\ 2 \\ \\ \\ \\ 3 \\ \\ \\ \\, 4 \\ \\ \\ \\ b \\\\\\ \u0026amp;x=-L \\ - \\ - \\ - \\ - \\ \\ L \\end{align*} We impose Dirichlet boundary conditions, $u(-L)=u_{a}, u(L)=u_{b}$ and use the centered finite difference approximation at every point in the mesh. We arrive at the four equations: \\begin{align*}\r\\left(d_{x x} u\\right)_{1} \u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^{2}}\\left(u_{a}-2 u_{1}+u_{2}\\right) \\qquad \\left(d_{x x} u\\right)_{2} =\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^{2}}\\left(u_{1}-2 u_{2}+u_{3}\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\left(d_{x x} u\\right)_{3} \u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^{2}}\\left(u_{2}-2 u_{3}+u_{4}\\right) \\qquad \\left(d_{x x} u\\right)_{4} =\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^{2}}\\left(u_{3}-2 u_{4}+u_{b}\\right)\r\\end{align*}\rIntroducing \\begin{align*} \\vec{u}=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\psi_{1} \\\\\\ \\psi_{2} \\\\\\ \\psi_{3} \\\\\\ \\psi_{4} \\end{array} \\right) \\quad (\\overrightarrow{b c})=\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^{2}} \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\psi_{a} \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\ \\psi_{b} \\end{array} \\right) \\quad A=\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^{2}} \\left( \\begin{array}{rrrr} -2 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; -2 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\\\\\ \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; -2 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\\\ \u0026amp; \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; -2 \\end{array} \\right) \\end{align*} we can rewrite in matrix form as \\begin{align*} \\frac{d^2 \\psi}{dx^2} =\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^{2}}D= A \\vec{\\psi}+(\\overrightarrow{b c}) \\end{align*}\nPeriodic boundary conditions $\\color{red}{\\text{This subsection has to tested and worked out.
